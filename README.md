# shell-scripts
Small shell scripts for various purposes:

* `simctl`: simply calls `xcrun simctl` with all parameters if you cannot remember that
* `plist-sort`: sorts the keys of a plist file
* `xctdiff`: call a diff tool on the output of a XCTAssertEqual for easier comparison
* `pwd-finder`: prints the path of the topmost Finder window
